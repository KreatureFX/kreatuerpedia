          <h2>Hacker</h2>
          <p>
A <b>hacker</b> is a person skilled in <mark style="color:blue;"> information technology</mark>  who uses their technical knowledge to achieve <br /> goal or overcome an obstacle, within a<b> computerized system </b>by non-standard means. Though the term hacker has <br /> become associated in popular culture with a <b>security hacker</b> – someone who utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be inaccessible to them – hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations. For example, law enforcement agencies sometimes use hacking techniques in order to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors. This could include using anonymity tools (such as a <b>VPN</b>, or the <b>dark web</b>) to mask their identities online, posing as criminals themselves.[1][2] Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal conduct of their work. On the other hand, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by law enforcement and security agencies (conducting warrantless activities), and employed by state actors as a weapon of both legal and illegal warfare.</p><br />

              <!-- Black hat --> 
              
           <p> <b>  A black hat is a computer hacker who usually violates laws or typical ethical standards. The term originates from 1950s westerns, when bad guys typically wore black hats and good guys white hats. Black hat hackers aim to hack into any system for their own profit or out of malice.</b></p>

           <p><b>A white hat is an ethical security hacker. Ethical hacking is a term meant to imply a broader category than just penetration testing. Under the owner's consent, white-hat hackers aim to identify any vulnerabilities or security issues the current system has.</b></p>

         <p><b>A grey hat is a computer hacker or computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but usually does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker. The term came into use in the late 1990s, and was derived from the concepts of "white hat" and "black hat" hackers.</b></p>
